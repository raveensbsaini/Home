- Messages marked as `bug:optional` are serious issues but not required to be fixed, you can ignore them.
- Messages marked as `bug` are serious issues and needs to be fixed.
- All other messages are just informational. No action required, but if you want to use these feel free to do so.

## cat.py

1. [bug:optional]: It prints extra empty line between all lines. Try `python3 cat.py tee.py` to see what I mean, there will be extra empty lines, which are not present in `tee.py`.

2. [random trivia]: Windows and Linux represent newline differently, windows uses `\r\n` and linux uses only `\n`, so a robuse `cat` implementation will take this into acount and will preseve the `\r\n` correctly if present. We _don't_ need to handle this. 

3. [useful stuff]: See `pathlib` module in python. It is handy for dealing with file and folder paths in python. 
  ```python3
  # An example
  from pathlib import Path

  file = Path("/some/folder") / 'tee.py'

  # NOTE that your code is more resource efficient than this. This will load the whole file in memory,
  # so if you are trying to print a 12GB file on system with 8GB ram, this code will not work, but your code will.
  content = file.read_text()
  file.write_text('some text')

  # or
  content_in_bytes = file.read_bytes()
  ```

4. [useful stuff]: See `argparse` module in python. It is handy for dealing with arguments in python i.e. it can automatically generate `--help`, error messages etc. I am attaching an example generated by `gemini` AI below.
  ```python3
  # Usage
  # python add.py 5 3
  # python add.py --help
  # python add.py 3 # this will be an error

  import argparse

  # Create an ArgumentParser object
  parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Add two numbers")

  # Add an argument for the first number
  parser.add_argument("first_number", type=int, help="The first number to add")

  # Add an argument for the second number
  parser.add_argument("second_number", type=int, help="The second number to add")

  # Parse the arguments from the command line
  args = parser.parse_args()

  # Add the two numbers and print the result
  result = args.first_number + args.second_number
  print(f"The sum of {args.first_number} and {args.second_number} is {result}")
  ```

## ls.py
- Okay.


## tee.py
- [bug]: This is not actually doing what the real `tee` does. `tee` takes the message from stdin not as an argument. `tee` is to be used like this. 
  ```
  # Store the output of `python3 my_command.py` into xyz.txt and also print on terminal
  python3 my_command.py | tee xyz.txt
  ```

## head.py
- [bug]: 
```sh
# Prints starting lines of some_file using following syntax
cat some_file | head
```

## tail.py
- Same issue as head
